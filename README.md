# Compound Calculator

Creating a compound interest calculator in Python is a great way to combine financial knowledge with programming skills. Such a calculator would require functions to input the principal amount, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and the time period for the investment.

Python's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for building financial tools that can be easily understood and used by others.
